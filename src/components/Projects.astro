          Django based web application that allows users to submit and view math tutorial videos, separated into four
          different categories of mathematics. Users can title and describe the videos, as well as give a caption that
          will go under the video in the detail view of each post. I learned the most about Django and MVC architecture
          from this project by far, and I believe that I got some good practice with styling elements in CSS, and
          properly structuring HTML divs. The project was live on the domain ivymath.net for about a year, and was
          hosted on Linode.

          Simple 2D game using python with the pygame library. The player spawns on the ground, in the middle of the
          screen, and can use A,D and Space to move and jump. As soon as the game is launched, traffic cones start
          falling out of the sky. It is the player's job to avoid contact with those traffic cones as they fall from the
          sky. From this project, I learned a lot about object oriented programming concepts, proper formatting to allow
          for efficient debugging later on, and specific game related things like how to integrate physics for the
          player.

          Integrates a Django backend with a simple post model with image and caption fields. Users can create an
          account, post pictures, and view other posts on their feed. Users can have their own profile associated with
          their own unique username, similar to Instagram. This project allowed me to further explore Django and MVC
          architecture in general, and gave a deeper understanding of what it takes to create a full stack user account
          based application.

          Multi-user platform using Django and Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. CSS styling explores a different type of
          interface aiming more towards the facebook/linkedin status page type. Similar to the last project, this also
          included a post model with a bio field and image field, and allows each user to create a profile, have their
          own profile picture, bio, and allows them to edit any time.
